This repository serves as a test bed for Spring Boot capabilities and concepts. You will find different Spring Boot projects that emphasize and demonstrate various features and techniques.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Java 11 or later
* Maven or Gradle (the build tool of your choice)

**Building and Running:**

There will be some projects in the repository that include individual building and running instructions. This information is usually found in each project's README file. The general procedure could be:

1. Change into the repository directory of the project.
2. Build the project using `mvn clean install` with Maven, or `gradle clean build` with Gradle.
3. Run the class containing the main method; this is normally located under `src/main/java`. The name itself of the class is to be found in the README of the project.

**Projects:**

The repository is empty at this point in time. In due course of time, it would be filled with a number of variety Spring Boot experiment projects. Here are some potential projects given as an idea:

 Simple REST API with CRUD
 Example using Spring Data JPA with database interaction
 User authentication via Spring Security integration
 Spring Boot application with WebSockets for real-time communication
 Spring Cloud project with microservices architecture
